# About

I am a PhD student in the [Quantum Information Theory group](http://www.qit.ethz.ch/) at the [Institute of Theoretical Physics](http://www.itp.phys.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html).

My interest lies in the interface between quantum physics and theoretical computer science. My current focus is mainly on Device-independent Quantum Cryptography.
