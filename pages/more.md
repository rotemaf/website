### Quotes
Instead of adding some deep quote underneath my photo, here are some motivating quotes I came across with during my studies so far:

"If I have done the public any service, it is due to my patient thought." <font color="gray"> -- Isaac Newton</font>

"The road to success is always under construction." <font color="gray"> -- Lily Tomlin </font>

"It is infinite alone that cannot be attained, for if it could, it would become finite." <font color="gray"> -- Leonardo de Vinci</font>
